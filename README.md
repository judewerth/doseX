# Project Overview

## Problem Statement

Prescription opioid abuse is an increasingly prevalent public health issue, yet current technologies offer little to prevent or discourage misuse. Standard intake instructions often fail to guide patients toward safe dosing practices, and communication among clinicians, pharmacies, and patients remains limited. Together, these gaps contribute to unsafe medication use and hinder effective monitoring and intervention.

## Our Solution

Our solution addresses these challenges by creating a smart, secure pill-dispensing system that promotes safe opioid use through guided dosing, real-time monitoring, and improved communication. The device incorporates a solenoid-based locking mechanism and enhanced child-safety features to restrict access outside healthy physiological windows, while an internal load cell continuously measures pill counts. Using a Wi-Fi microcontroller, these weight data are uploaded to a cloud database, allowing dosage history to be recorded and shared with the patient through a convenient mobile app built with React Native and Expo. Within the app, patients report their pain level—high, low, or none—which the system translates into tailored recommendations of one to three pills based on the drug’s profile. A physical indicator on the device communicates its dosing state, and a rechargeable power system ensures reliable operation. Together, these features deter unhealthy consumption, strengthen safe storage, and empower patients with clear, personalized guidance to support responsible opioid use.
